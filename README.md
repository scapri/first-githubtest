# first-githubtest
This is a test github repository.  Not too much interesting stuff here.
Git is great for those of us that love the command line (like myself)
But for folks that need a gui, it is a bit of a problem.
I've tried many different guis, but I haven't really liked any of them except GitKraken.
And my idea of a fine gui for me (since I only want tree visualization) is git lola/lg
Ah well, I'm an old fogey that's stuck on command line interfaces. :-)


This is the official bug fix for my test bug!  Will the issue tracker show me this sha?
Fixes #6
